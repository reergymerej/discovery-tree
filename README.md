# Discovery Tree

Use these to find information about an unknown.  They add structure to your
information gathering and keep you from getting lost.

* Each Q leads to one A or multiple Q's.
* A's will often lead to more refined Q's.
* A's all have some value and build the overall context for their Q ancestors.
* These are infinite, so make sure you keep an eye on the root Q you are answering.
* As A's are discovered, they may lead to clarifying Q's or A's above the discovered A.

**Example**

```text
Q. What kind of data structure is this?
	A. This is a tree.

	Q. What kind of data structures are there?
		A. Tree, list, stacks, etc.

		Q.  How can you tell the difference between a tree an list?
			A. List is linear, tree has branches.

		Q. Is tree or trie?
			A. They are different structures.

			Q. What's the difference between tree and trie?
				A. A [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) is a specific type of tree.  Each node in a trie, re**TRIE**val tree, is part of a sequence that is added to at each step.  
```


## Notes

* keep A's immediately under Q's - This makes it easy to find answers and
  preserves the history of related/spin-off questions.

* Add a space under each A - This makes it easy to see where answers are
  missing.

* Do not add spaces under Q's - This helps when viewing in an editor where you 
  can collapse as it will show the answer even if there are many supporting 
  questions.  Also, cluttered Q's just _beg_ for breathing room, so you will be 
  drawn toward unanswered questions.

* Do not wrap text - This keeps things short and sweet.

* Answers can and should be added or refined as you discover more info.

* Any Q can be split off into a standalone Discovery Tree.
